    <p style="font-size: 35px;">Peafowl </p> <hr>
    <p>Peafowl is a common name for three bird species in the genera Pavo and Afropavo within the tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae, 
    the pheasants and their allies. <br> Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are
    referred to as peahens, even though peafowl of either sex are
    often referred to colloquially as <br> "peacocks".[1] 
    <br><br>  The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally of the Indian subcontinent,
    and the green peafowl of Southeast Asia; the one African species is the <br> Congo peafowl,
    native only to the Congo Basin. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant 
    plumage. The latter is especially prominent <br> in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted "tail" or 
    "train" of covert feathers, which they display as part of a courtship ritual. <br><br>
    The functions of the elaborate iridescent colouration and large "train" of peacocks have been the subject of extensive scientific debate.
    Charles Darwin suggested <br> that they served to attract females, and the showy features of the males had evolved by sexual selection. 
    More recently, Amotz Zahavi proposed in his handicap theory <br> that these features acted as honest signals of the males' fitness,
    since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large and <br> conspicuous structures.

<p style="font-size: 35px;">Plumage</p> <hr>
    <p>The Indian peacock has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metallic blue and green, but the green peacock has green and
         bronze body feathers. In both species, <br> females are a little smaller than males in terms of weight and wingspan, but males 
         are significantly longer due to the "tail", also known as a "train".[2] The peacock train <br> consists not of tail quill 
         feathers, but highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a peacock 
         fans his tail. Both sexes of all species have a crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, 
         brown, and green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal danger
          to her young.</p>
